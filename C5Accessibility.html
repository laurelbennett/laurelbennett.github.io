    <h2>Challenge 5: Accessibility Concerns</h2>
    <p>Some accessibilty concerns I have after finishing the challenges was realizing I <br> didn't put in a
      back button. This may cause challenges for those who can't find the <br> back button on their browser, or if it doesn't work.
      Another thing I thought about was how many browsers display websites differently, so the fonts may appear too small or too big, or the icons,
      <br> (like on the chessboard.)
